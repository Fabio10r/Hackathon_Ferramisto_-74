Hackathon project - Ferramisto Team -  Academia de código - Shellbys #74

Creation of a web app, based on the main theme of the Academia de Código Hackathon - “Vacations”, where a random country was attributed to each team.

We had 24 hours to develop a web app, based in our theme “Thailand”. Our idea was to develop an app that might help women who are not allowed to speak freely about their love affairs. For that, we thought about providing different services and even a log. Then a supporter would chat to them, providing advice about their problems.

The application persists data, if any problems appear regarding this feature it might result from an incorrect server timezone.

Frontend folder is located on the main project branch.

Please take into consideration that this was an educational project, and that it isn't completely finished.

Technologies used: Java, Hibernate, Spring, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, HTML.
